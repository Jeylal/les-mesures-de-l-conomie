	abstract = {This paper aims to contribute to the debate of post-Keynesian growth models and the political economy of populism by investigating the relationship between the changes in demand and growth regimes and the politics of the right-wing populist governments in Poland and Hungary after the Global Financial Crisis ({GFC}). In both countries, the {GFC} was a turning point, leading to the emergence of new economic and political ideas. These processes resulted in changes in the growth regimes and increased the importance of the export sector.},
